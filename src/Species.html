                <h2>Simple Organisms: Chemosynthetic Bacteria</h2>
                <p class="description">
                      Chemobacteria: These are the most basic life forms in your ocean world. They 
thrive near hydrothermal vents, where they use chemicals like hydrogen sulfide 
(H₂S) or methane (CH₄) to produce energy through chemosynthesis. They 
convert these chemicals into organic compounds, forming the base of the food 
chain. <br>
- Sulfoxides: Another type of bacteria that uses sulfur compounds to generate 
energy. They form dense mats around the vents and release oxygen as a 
byproduct.</p>

                <p class="description">
                    2. Filter Feeders (Chemofilters): Small, worm-like creatures that feed on 
                    chemobacteria by filtering them from the water. They have specialized gills to 
                    extract these bacteria from the surrounding water. -Grazer Worms: Slightly larger, slug-like organisms that crawl over the bacterial 
                    mats, grazing on the chemobacteria. Their digestive systems are adapted to 
                    break down the tough cell walls of the bacteria.  </p>

                <p class="description">
                    3. Predators and Scavengers - Vent Serpents: Serpent-like creatures that prey on chemofilters and grazer 
                    worms. They use their elongated bodies to navigate through narrow crevices 
                    near the hydrothermal vents, ambushing their prey. - Chemohunters: Large, slow-moving fish that hunt vent serpents and other 
                    smaller predators. They have thick, armored scales to protect against the toxic 
                    environment and sharp, needle-like teeth to pierce their prey. - Scavenger Crustaceans: Crab-like organisms that feed on the remains of dead 
                    animals. They have powerful claws to break open tough exoskeletons and a 
                    keen sense of smell to locate carcasses in the dark waters.  </p>

                    4.  Deep-Sea Leviathans: Massive creatures that dominate the ocean world’s 
                    food chain. These leviathans hunt chemohunters and other large predators. 
                    They have bioluminescent lures to attract prey and powerful jaws capable of 
                    crushing anything in their path.  </p>

                <p class="description">
                    5. Symbiotic Algae: Algae that live on the bodies of larger creatures, particularly 
the deep-sea leviathans. These algae utilize trace amounts of light or thermal 
energy to produce nutrients that benefit both the algae and their host. - Decomposers (Decompozoa): Microscopic organisms that break down dead 
organic matter, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. They thrive in the 
sediment around the hydrothermal vents, feeding on the detritus that falls 
from above. </p>
